# Deep-Learning-Project
Deep Learning Project for Data Science BHT

In this project we grab Odometry data from a driven Robot simulated in Gazebo. 
Then we exctract the timestamps with the corresponding x-positions of the Robot.
We create a imple Neural Network and train it with this data.
Afterward we predict the position based on timestamps.
Finally we plot the results.
